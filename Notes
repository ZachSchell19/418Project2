Notes For Google cloud Project 2:

I have decided to go with Fedora. Nothing against Rocky Linux and I wont lie have have done 0 research into them. I use a different version of Linux on my machine.

I chose Fedora because it sounded funny and cool and "Rocky" Linux makes me think this will be a rocky project.

I had trouble at fist connecting with SSH to the first instance i made. i had the region different than my first instance.
I searched the internet for help, but after 5 minutes I gave up. I just decided to delete the instance and then recreate it in the same region and zone.
Guess what? It worked. I was shocked.
Now in with Fedora I started by typing pwd and found i was in /home/me. I messed around after looking up basic fedora commands.
